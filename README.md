# Voter Inequality in Canada 2015

In the Canadian electoral system, not all votes are equal. 
Some ridings are expected to be a very tight race between two 
or even three parties (i.e. swing ridings, like Brampton Centre 
between the Liberals and Conservatives). Other ridings are
expected to be won easily by a specific party (i.e. safe ridings like 
Vancouver Quadra which will almost certainly be won by the Liberals). 
A vote cast that contributes to one of the tight races is worth
a lot more, strategically speaking, than a vote for any party in 
a very safe riding. Like baseball cards, some votes are worth a lot
in the election and others have only symbolic value.  

In economic terms, votes are non-fungible. There are even some scenarios
where two people from different ridings could benefit by swapping votes with each other.
In fact, an economy has formed in Canada for exchanging votes (see http://voteswap.ca/Main_Page ).

The purpose of this project is to explore the statistics of voter inequality visually by 
showing who are the most powerful voters, who are the most powerless voters, and how 
much inequality exists between those groups. This will be based on the 
election forcasting data provided by http://www.threehundredeight.com. I will also create a tool 
that will help vote swappers discover which ridings they should target to find vote 
swapping partners.
